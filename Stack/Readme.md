## Tests

1. Can create Stack object
2. Newly created stacks should be empty
3. After one push, stack size should be one
4. After one push and one pop, should be empty
5. When pushed passed limit, stack overflows
6. When popped passed limit, stack underflows
7. When two values are pushed then one is popped, size is one
8. When one is pushed one is popped
9. When one and two are pushed two and one are popped
10. When creating stack with negative size, should through IllegalCapacity
11. When Creating stack with zero capacity, any push should overflow
12. When one is pushed, one is on top
13. When stack is empty, top throws empty
14. With zero capacity stack, top throws empty
15. Given stack with one two pushed, find one and two
16. Given a stack with no two, find two returns null
